# Maritime Surveillance Intelligence Generator — Containerized

**Powered by HP ZGX Nano AI Station**

Vision Language Model (VLM) demonstration for US Navy reconnaissance imagery analysis with synthetic geolocation and structured intelligence report generation. Runs entirely on-premises with no cloud dependency.

---

## What This Demo Is

A fully functional maritime surveillance intelligence tool that analyzes reconnaissance imagery in real time. Upload an aerial or satellite image of a vessel and the system generates a structured intelligence report including vessel classification, threat assessment, synthetic geolocation, and contextual recommendations.

The application runs **Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct**, a state-of-the-art vision-language model served via **vLLM** for high-performance GPU inference. A single model handles both image understanding and natural language report generation — no separate text model needed.

### Two Example Scenarios

**Non-threatening** — Upload `overhead-ship.jpg` (aerial photo of a cruise ship) to demonstrate commercial vessel identification with NONE/LOW threat assessment.

**Adversarial** — Upload `navy-ship.jpg` (aerial photo of a naval vessel) to demonstrate military vessel detection with HIGH threat classification and escalated recommendations.

---

## What It Proves to Customers

1. **Classified imagery never leaves the platform.** Reconnaissance data stays within the secure environment — no cloud APIs, no network round-trips.

2. **Real-time analysis without connectivity.** Functions aboard ships at sea, in SCIFs, or in any disconnected environment. Zero dependency on satellite uplink.

3. **Vision AI runs locally on HP hardware.** An 8-billion parameter multimodal model analyzing images in seconds, on hardware the customer owns and controls.

4. **No per-query costs.** Unlike cloud vision APIs that charge per image, on-premises inference has zero marginal cost.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/curtburk/navy-surveillance-containerized-docker.git
cd navy-surveillance-containerized-docker

# 2. Download the model (~16GB)
./download_models.sh

# 3. Start the demo
./start.sh
```

The terminal will print a clickable URL with the host IP (e.g., `http://192.168.x.x:8000`). First startup takes 2-3 minutes for model loading.

**Frontend** — Military-themed HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface with image upload, region selection, and structured report display.

**Backend** — FastAPI server that receives image uploads, base64-encodes them, and sends multimodal prompts to vLLM's OpenAI-compatible API. Handles threat classification, geolocation generation, and report assembly.

**Inference Engine** — vLLM serving Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct in BF16 on GPU. Exposes an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint on internal port 8090. Handles both image understanding and text generation in a single model.

**Containerization** — Based on `nvcr.io/nvidia/vllm:26.01-py3`. The entrypoint script starts vLLM in the background, waits for model loading, then starts the FastAPI application. The ~16GB model stays on the host and is mounted read-only.

## The Customer Conversation

**Opening:** "Let me show you what happens when you put a vision-language AI model on hardware that never needs to phone home."

**During Demo:** Upload the sample ship images. Select operationally relevant AORs. Walk through the 6-section intelligence report — vessel classification, physical characteristics, activity assessment, threat level, confidence, and recommendations.

**Key Messages:**
- "This image was analyzed by an 8-billion parameter multimodal AI, running locally"
- "The imagery never left this machine — no cloud, no API calls, no network required"
- "This works aboard a ship at sea with zero connectivity"
- "No per-image charges — analyze as many images as you need"

**Closing:** "This is one example. The same hardware runs any AI workload where your data cannot leave your environment."

---

## Stopping

```bash
docker compose down
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Docker daemon not running**
```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

**Permission denied on Docker commands**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker
```

**Model not found at startup** — Ensure `Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct/` directory exists in `./models/`. Run `./download_models.sh` if missing.

**vLLM fails to start** — Check GPU memory with `nvidia-smi`. The model requires ~16GB VRAM in BF16. Ensure no other GPU processes are consuming memory.

**Slow first analysis** — Normal. The first image analysis after startup may take longer as vLLM warms up. Subsequent analyses are faster.

**Cannot connect from another machine** — Verify the firewall allows port 8000:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 8000
```
